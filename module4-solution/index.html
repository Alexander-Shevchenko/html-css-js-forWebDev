    <h2>Hi! Hope you are doing well at this challenging times.</h2>
    <p>I wanted to mention that even "harder" starter option turned to be quite easy,<br>
       so as a bonus I added a simple test of comparing what I produce to the console against expected Hello's & GoodBye's.</p>
    <p>Test output goes at the end, collapsed in the console group and starting with "~~~".</p>
    <h3>Kind regards,<br>Alex</h3>
